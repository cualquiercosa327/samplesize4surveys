\title{Estimated sample Effects of Design (DEFF)}
\usage{
DEFF(y, pik)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Vector, matrix or data frame containing the recollected information of the variables of interest for every unit in the selected sample.}

\item{pik}{Vector of inclusion probabilities for each unit in the selected sample.}
}
\description{
This function returns the estimated design effects for a set of inclusion probabilities and the variables of interest.
}
\details{
The design effect is somehow defined to be the ratio between the variance of a complex design and the variance of a simple design. 
When the design is stratified and the allocation is proportional, this measures reduces to
\deqn{DEFF_{Kish} = 1 + CV(w)}
where w is the set of weights (defined as the inverse of the inclusion probabilities) along the sample, and CV refers 
to the classical coefficient of variation. Although this measure is #' motivated by a stratified sampling design, 
it is commonly applied to any kind of survey where sampling weight are unequal. On the other hand, the Spencer's DEFF 
is motivated by the idea that a set of weights may be efficent even when they vary, and is defined by:
\deqn{DEFF_{Spencer} = (1 - R^2) * DEFF_{Kish} + \frac{\hat{a}^2}{\hat{\sigma}^2_y} * (DEFF_{Kish} - 1) }
where 
\deqn{\hat{\sigma}^2_y = \frac{\sum_s w_k (y_k - \bar{y}_w)^2}{\sum_s w_k}}
and \eqn{\hat{a}} is the estimation of the intercept in the following model
\deqn{y_k = a + b * p_k + e_k}
with \eqn{p_k = \pi_k / n} is an standardized sampling weight. Finnaly, \eqn{R^2} is the R-squared of this model.
